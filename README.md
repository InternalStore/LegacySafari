## Description
This is a script which will enable the legacy tab bar in Safari on macOS Monterey. This is made possible thanks to Twitter user [Zhuowei Zhang](https://www.twitter.com/zhuowei) and the research he has done. This script just automates the process so that users can quickly and easily enable the legacy tab bar in Safari. Please be careful with this script. This script is brand new and has not been tested on a variety of devices. It is *highly reccomended* that you create a backup before running this script in case anything is corrupted.
